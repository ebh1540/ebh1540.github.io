#Ethan Herbst

For high school, I attended Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, New Jersey, a magnet school for my county. I was in the Computer Science academy (basically just a track), so I've been involved in programming for a few years now. I'm Jewish and and somewhat involved in my local temple; I was on their youth group board last year, and I virtually attended their high holiday services this year (a silver lining of the pandemic). I play a lot of Super Smash Bros. and I'm looking to get more involved in that community here at RIT. 

My favorite food is cheeseburgers.

A few things I'd like to learn from the course:
- Industry standards for collaborative work on projects
- How to better pitch software products to non-computer people
- Ethical implications in more complex forms of software work
- More about my peers!
